				<h1>A 10 CAMPUS MISSION</h1>
				<p>The Blum Center for Developing Economies is the only center to be found on all 10 UC campuses. Founded in 2006 by UC Regent Richard Blum, the Blum Center was created to address the world’s most pressing problems by leveraging the resources of the UC, the largest public research university in the world. It its core, the Blum Federation’s mission is to eliminate global poverty through the power of public research. At UC Merced, before we can consider any international ecosystem of poverty, we must first address the some 12,000 square miles of California’s San Joaquin Valley.</p>

				<p>To us, the community comes first. We believe public research is for the public good, and that public should play a large role in establishing the research agenda. The Blum Center promotes collaborations between community members, industry stakeholders, students, and faculty. We believe that such direct partnerships are necessary to ensure the maximal impact and effectiveness of new innovations and the resolution of systemic community problems.</p>

				<h1>STUDENT SUCCESS</h1>
				<p>We are all students and teachers. We truly believe that the answers to the complex problems we hope to resolve lie within the minds of students.

The Blum Center supports student projects promoting wealth equity and public health for the San Joaquin Valley. We are committed to student success by providing real-world experiences that teach communication, project management, leadership, fundraising, and other task-oriented skills.</p>
